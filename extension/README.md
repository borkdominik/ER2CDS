**Main features:**
- **üìù Textual Language** for the specification of ER2CDS models in the textual editor. Assistive *validation* and *rich-text editing* support, enabled with the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/), allows to quickly get familiar with the available language constructs.
- üìä **Diagram View** that is fully synchronized with the textual model and automatically updates on changes. Also offers an interactive toolbar with *graphical editing actions*, *layout mechanisms*, and *multi-notation support*
- üñ®Ô∏è **Code Generation** to *generate CDS view entities* out of the specified ER2CDS models and integrate with existing databases.
- üì• **Import** of *existing CDS view entities* from a connected SAP S/4HANA system.

## About the Project
ER2CDS aims to provide an open-source and modern solution for a model-driven development process of CDS by making use of the [Language Server Protocol (LSP)](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/). The protocol is used for communicating textual language features to the VS Code client and is further extended to also support graphical editing. Additionally, a webservice deployed directly on a SAP S/4HANA system allows to integrate the system's datamodel into ER2CDS.

**Research**
The tool is based on extensive research. The evaluation results can be found in [Evaluation](../evaluation).

**Built With**
The language server is realized with [Langium](https://langium.org/), while the diagramming capabilities are based on [Sprotty](https://github.com/eclipse/sprotty). Sprotty enhances the server with graphical language features (using [`sprotty-server`](https://github.com/eclipse/sprotty-server)) and integrates with VS Code through [Sprotty VS Code Extensions](https://github.com/eclipse/sprotty-vscode). 


## Usage
Download and install the extension using the [.vsix](../er2cds-0.0.1.vsix) file provided in this repository.

```bash
code --install-extension er2cds-0.0.1.vsix
```

**New ER2CDS Model**
After installation, ER2CDS models can be created in `.er2cds` files. Use the example below to get started with a basic model.

```java
er2cds ZER2CDS_MANAGER

entity Employee {
   key PERNR : NUMC
   FNAME : CHAR as FirstName
   LNAME : CHAR as LastName
   DEPARTMENT_ID : NUMC
}

entity Department {
   no-out DEPARTMENT_ID : NUMC
   NAME : CHAR as DepartmentName
   LOC : CHAR as Location
}

relationship manages {
   Employee[1] -> Department[1]
   join order 1
   DEPARTMENT_ID = DEPARTMENT_ID
}
```

**Open the Diagram**
The corresponding *ER2CDS Diagram* can be opened by using the button in the editor toolbar, the context menu when right-clicking the file, or by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>‚åò</kbd> + <kbd>O</kbd>.

**(Optional) Connect SAP S/4HANA**
1. Create the [CDS view entities](../odata-service/)
2. Create the [Service Definition](../odata-service/ZER2CDS.sdef)
3. Create a Service Binding (ZER2CDS) for the Service Definition
4. Publish the service under `/sap/opu/odata/sap/ZER2CDS`

**Learn More**
For more information on how to use the tool, see the [ER2CDS Wiki](https://github.com/borkdominik/ER2CDS/wiki/).
